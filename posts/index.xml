      <description>Vamsi was a 12-year-old boy who lived with his father. He was very healthy, a bit too healthy, one can say. He was round like a tomato, and that&amp;rsquo;s what his classmates used to call him. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t very popular and didn&amp;rsquo;t have any friends. They had recently moved to a new city where his father got a new job and had bought a new house on the outskirts of the town because it was a bit close to his work and Vamsi&amp;rsquo;s new School.</description>
